            <p>As i laid on my bed this evening, my bedding soaked in perspiration, i though to myself "was it really blue I
                saw? Like how could Sam have dealt me such a mighty punch which knocked me out flat. I used to be much stronger
                than this. Or has he been secretly hitting the gym without my knowing? Whatever be his secret, I can't acertain.
                The only sure thing was that Sam punched me hard in the face... and i saw blue.</p>
