current issue: app is not defined in entriesRouter and usersRouter  15/08/2018
used circular reference to solve the above  16/08/2018

lessons learnt 16/08/18
    app.use app.get ... are event listeners which will run only once per server request
    you can only call them in the app.js then use conditionals to execute to execute code in your router and controller
    JSON data use only double quotes (") and NOT single qoutes (') to wrap keys and values
    Array.filter will always run to last iteration regardless of whether there is a return within it or not
    Array.every can only halt iteration if you explicitly return false.
    To return a desirable array element use filter or better still the traditional for loop

TODO    remove debugging console.logs
        uncomment user login validation in controller
        replace 'export default' for deconstructing exports
